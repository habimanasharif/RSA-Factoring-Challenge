## What is RSA

RSA is an algorithm that take to large prime numbers and multiply them to create a public key.

## Example of use of RSA algorithm
 
An example of RSA algorithm use is Secure Socket Layer (SSLS) implementation

Here two prime numbers are Multiplied and a public key is created which is later use to encrypt the data sent by the cleint to the server and then the server uses the two prime numbers to decrypt the data sent by the clent
